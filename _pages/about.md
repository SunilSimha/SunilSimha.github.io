I am a observational astronomer interested in diffuse plasma within dark matter halos and in the filaments of the cosmic web. My current choice of probes of the gas is Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). FRBs are millisecond-duration transient events that can only be observed with radio telescopes. All radio light travelling through space is dispersed by the plasma that is prevalent along its path. Due to their short duration, the extent of dispersion can be precisely measured for FRBs. FRB dispersion measures (DMs) therefore provide us with precise estimates of the total column of diffuse gas they have propagated through.

I am currently involved in the [FLIMFLAM survey](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928....9L/abstract), an effort to map the foreground galaxies along FRB sightlines to build a detailed map of gas they travelled through. In modeling the FRB DMs for a sample of 30 FRBs, we can [lay constraints](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...973..151K/abstract) on the gas fractions contained within halos and the cosmic web filaments. The exact values of these fractions hold the key to understanding how gas is ejected by galaxies through supernovae and black hole activity.
